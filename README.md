# ai-prompt-engineering-portfolio
This repository showcases my hands-on work in prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. It includes a collection of experiments, techniques, and mini-projects focused on designing, optimizing, and testing prompts for a variety of natural language processing tasks.
